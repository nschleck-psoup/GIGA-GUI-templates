# Arduino GIGA Display - GUI Templates Library
This is a public repository for Arduino GIGA / LVGL GUI templates.

Do you have an Arduino project that you would love to control via touchscreen display?\
Why are there no good, clean, plug-and-play GUI templates out there, which you can quickly adapt to your project?

This library aims to change that, by providing clean GUI templates, with plug-and-play Arduino functionality.\
As of now, templates are primarily built for the [Arduino GIGA Display](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-display-shield), although they may be easily adapted for other displays.\

Also includes STL files for a 3D printed enclosure. TODO

## Getting Started

- Download the Arduino IDE
- Install the LVGL library (version 8.3.11) in the Arduino IDE
- Install the "Arduino Mbed OS GIGA Boards" board manager
- Download and open one of the templates in this library
- Modify the template as your project requires
- Upload to your Arduino GIGA Display
- Rejoice

## Notices

- As of this writing, Arduino does not support the latest releases of LVGL. To ensure these templates compile properly, you must install LVGL version 8.3.11 in the Arduino IDE.
