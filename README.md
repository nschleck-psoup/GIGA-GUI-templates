# Arduino GIGA Display - GUI Templates Library
This is a public repository for Arduino GIGA / LVGL GUI templates.

Do you have an Arduino project that you would love to control via touchscreen display?
Why are there no good, clean, plug-and-play GUI templates out there, which you can quickly adapt to your project?

This library aims to change that, by providing clean GUI templates, with plug-and-play Arduino functionality.
As of now, templates are primarily built for the [Arduino GIGA Display](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-display-shield), although they may be easily adapted for other displays.
Also includes STL files for a 3D printed enclosure.
